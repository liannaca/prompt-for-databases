🧠 Prompt Engineering Project: Customer Review Analysis for Clothing Shop
📝 Project Goal

The goal of this prompt was to automate and speed up the process of analyzing a large number of customer reviews from a clothing store’s new collection. Instead of manually reading every comment, I created a detailed prompt that asks the AI to identify key patterns and insights across all products.

🔍 Key Research Questions

Using this prompt, I aimed to answer the following questions:

* What do customers **like** most about each product?
* What are they **not satisfied with**?
* Which product is the **most popular** overall?
* What are the **average ratings** and the **percentage of positive/negative feedback** for each item?

👚 Product Categories

The analysis focused on three clothing items:

1. Long-Sleeve Cotton Shirt
2. Short-Sleeve Cotton Shirt
3. Tank Top

📊 Desired Output

I expected a structured analysis that included:

* Most liked and disliked features of each product
* Most popular size and color
* Average rating per product
* Percentage of **excellent**, **good**, and **bad** reviews
* A general conclusion summarizing common customer opinions

✅ Purpose

The prompt helped turn unstructured customer feedback into clear, actionable data. This approach saves time and provides helpful insights for marketing, product improvement, and planning the **Autumn 2025 collection**.

📁 Outcome

The result was a readable, well-organized summary that reflects real customer sentiment. This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can streamline customer research and support business decisions using AI.
